## Game instructions

- This game is an endless runner platformer. The plataforms appear infinitly until the game ends and the game character (a cat) has to jump from building to building.
- If the cat falls below the edge of the screen the game ends.
- Your progress (score) is measured in seconds. The longer the cat stays "alive" higher the score.
- To jump you have to simply click on the screen with the left mouse button.
- The cat can jump twice. After the second jump, the cat has to touch a platform to be able to jump again.
- On the game over screen you can input your name and click on the "Save Score" button, to save your score in a leaderbord.
- If no name is given, the name "Default User" will be attributed.
- If you access the leaderboard (by clicking on the "Leaderboard" button) without saving your score, the score for that run WILL BE LOST!
- If you chose to return to the title screen (by clicking on the "Title Screen" button) without saving your score, the score for that run WILL BE LOST!
- By clicking on the "Leaderboard" button, on the Title screen or on the game over screen, You will be shown a Leaderboard with the top 10 scores.
