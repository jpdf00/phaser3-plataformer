## Game Description.

This game is an endless runner platformer. The plataforms appear infinitly until the game ends and the game character (a cat) has to jump from building to building.
If the cat falls below the edge of the screen the game ends.
Your progress (score) is measured in seconds. The longer the cat stays "alive" higher the score.
To jump you have to simply click on the screen with the left mouse button.
The cat can jump twice. After the second jump, the cat has to touch a platform to be able to jump again.

On the game over screen you can input your name and click on the "Save Score" button, to save your score in a leaderbord.
If no name is given, the name "Dafault User" will be attributed.
If you access the leaderboard (by clicking on the "Leaderboard" button) without saving your score, the score for that run WILL BE LOST!
If you chose to return to the title screen (by clicking on the "Title Screen" button) without saving your score, the score for that run WILL BE LOST!
By clicking on the "Leaderboard" button, on the Title screen or on the game over screen, You will be shown a Leaderboard with the top 10 scores.
